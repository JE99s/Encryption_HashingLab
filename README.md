<h1>Applying Encryption and Hashing Algorithms for Secure Communications</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Project consists of common cryptographic techniques to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. I will create MD5 checksum and SHA-1 hashes on simple text files on a Linux virtual
machine (VM) and compare the hash values of the original files with those generated after the file has been modified. Then, I will use GnuPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) to generate an encryption key pair and encrypt a message. Finally, I will utilize those key pairs to send secure messages between two user accounts on the virtual machine and verify the integrity of received files</p>
